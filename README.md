Â© 2017 Alex Strandberg, Daniel Li, Ning Ning Sun, and Cynthia Tu.

## Installation

Note: we assume that you are running on the CS 3110 VM.  Please follow these [instructions](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs3110/2016fa/install.html) if you need to install them.

Camlization requires the [Notty](https://github.com/pqwy/notty) terminal graphics library.  


To install it using OPAM, run `opam install notty` and follow the prompts.

## Playing the Game
Simply run the Makefile with no options to play, by entering the code directory and running the command `make`.  This will compile the code and run the game.  


You can play the game again by running `make play` or `./main.byte`.


Note: Please maximize your terminal window or enter full-screen mode before running the game.  The GUI will resize according to terminal window size and font size.
