# Camlization
A Civilization V-inspired game written in OCaml

## Installation

Note: we assume that you are running on the CS 3110 VM or have installed OCaml and OPAM.  Please follow these [instructions](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs3110/2016fa/install.html) if you need to install them.

Camlization requires the [Notty](https://github.com/pqwy/notty) terminal graphics library.  To install it using OPAM, run `opam install notty` and follow the prompts.

## Playing the Game
Simply run the Makefile with no options to play, by entering the code directory and running the command `make`.  This will compile the code and run the game.  You can play the game again by running `make play` or `./main.byte`.
Note: Please maximize your terminal window or enter full-screen mode before running the game.  The GUI will resize according to terminal window size and font size.
